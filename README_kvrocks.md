**Apache Kvrocks(Incubating)** is a distributed key value NoSQL database that uses RocksDB as storage engine and is
compatible with Redis protocol. Kvrocks intends to decrease the cost of memory and increase the capacity while compared
to Redis. The design of replication and storage was inspired by `rocksplicator` and `blackwidow`.

Kvrocks has the following key features:

- Redis protocol, user can use redis client to visit the kvrocks
- Namespace, similar to redis db but use token per namespace
- Replication, async replication using binlog like MySQL
- High Available, supports redis sentinel to failover when master or slave was failed
- Cluster mode, centralized management but compatible with Redis cluster client access

> Thanks for designers @[田凌宇](https://github.com/tianlingyu1997) and @范世丽 contribute the kvrocks logo for us.

## Building kvrocks

#### requirements

* g++ (required by c++11, version >= 4.8)
* autoconf automake libtool cmake

#### Build

```shell
# Centos/Redhat
sudo yum install -y epel-release && sudo yum install -y git gcc gcc-c++ make cmake autoconf automake libtool which

# Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt update
sudo apt-get install gcc g++ make cmake autoconf automake libtool

# macOS
brew install autoconf automake libtool cmake
```

It is as simple as:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/apache/incubator-kvrocks.git
$ cd incubator-kvrocks
$ ./build.sh build # `./build.sh -h` to check more options;
                   # especially, `./build.sh build --ghproxy` will fetch dependencies via ghproxy.com.
```

### Running kvrocks

```shell
$ ./build/kvrocks -c kvrocks.conf
```

### Running kvrocks using Docker

```
$ docker run -it -p 6666:6666 kvrocks/kvrocks
```

### Connect kvrocks service

```
$ redis-cli -p 6666

127.0.0.1:6666> get a
(nil)
```

### Running test cases

```shell
$ ./build.sh build --unittest
$ cd build
$ ./unittest
```

### Supported platforms

* Linux distributions
    * CentOS 6 or 7
    * Ubuntu
    * and most other distros
* macOS

## Namespace

namespace was used to isolate data between users. unlike all the redis databases can be visited by `requirepass`, we use
one token per namespace. `requirepass` was regraded as admin token, only admin token allows to access the namespace
command, as well as some commands like `config`, `slaveof`, `bgsave`, etc…

```
# add token
127.0.0.1:6666>  namespace add ns1 my_token
OK

# update token
127.0.0.1:6666> namespace set ns1 new_token
OK

# list namespace
127.0.0.1:6666> namespace get *
1) "ns1"
2) "new_token"
3) "__namespace"
4) "foobared"

# delete namespace
127.0.0.1:6666> namespace del ns1
OK
```

## Cluster

Kvrocks implements a proxyless centralized cluster solution but its accessing method is completely compatible with the
Redis cluster client. You can use Redis cluster SDKs to access the kvrocks cluster. More details, please
see: [Kvrocks Cluster Introduction](https://github.com/apache/incubator-kvrocks/wiki/Kvrocks-Cluster-Introduction)

## DOCs

* [supported commands](https://github.com/apache/incubator-kvrocks/wiki/Support-Commands)
* [design complex kv on rocksdb](https://github.com/apache/incubator-kvrocks/blob/master/docs/metadata-design.md)
* [replication design](https://github.com/apache/incubator-kvrocks/blob/master/docs/replication-design.md)

For more informations, can see: [Kvrocks Wiki](https://github.com/apache/incubator-kvrocks/wiki)

## Tools

* Export the Kvrocks monitor metrics, please use [kvrocks_exporter](https://github.com/KvrocksLabs/kvrocks_exporter)
* Migrate from redis to kvrocks, use [redis-migrate-tool](https://github.com/vipshop/redis-migrate-tool) which was
  developed by vipshop
* Migrate from kvrocks to redis. use `kvrocks2redis` in build dir
